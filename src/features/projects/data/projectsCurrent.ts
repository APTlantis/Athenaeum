The tool scans through HTML archives of the original TempleOS website, identifies code blocks, and extracts them into organized files.

The extractor performs several key functions:
- Scans directories containing HTML files from TempleOS archives
- Filters content related to Terry Davis, TempleOS, or HolyC
- Extracts code snippets from HTML <pre> and <code> tags
- Identifies programming languages (HolyC, C, Assembly) using pattern matching
- Organizes extracted code by language into separate directories
- Adds metadata headers with source information and dates
- Processes files in parallel for efficiency

This tool was instrumental in creating the dataset used for fine-tuning the HolyC AI Model, allowing us to preserve and study Terry Davis's unique programming style and contributions to computing.`,

It's particularly useful for maintaining local mirrors of crates.io, where all crate files (approximately 1.5 million) are typically downloaded to a single flat directory.

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Crate Organizer**: Reorganizes Rust crates from a flat directory structure into a hierarchical structure with two levels of subdirectories based on filename, significantly reducing the number of files per directory for easier management.

2. **Metadata Organizer (Python)**: Processes metadata files from the crates.io-index repository and places them alongside their corresponding crate files, making it easier to access and use the metadata.

3. **Metadata Organizer (Go)**: A high-performance Go implementation of the metadata organizer, optimized for processing large numbers of files with features like pre-indexing, efficient parallelism, and regular progress updates.

Key features include multi-threaded processing, dry-run capability for testing, comprehensive logging, and intelligent grouping of directories to balance file distribution. The tools are designed to handle extremely large collections of files efficiently, with options for customizing directories, thread counts, and other parameters.`,
