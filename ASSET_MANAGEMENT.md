# Asset Management in APTlantis

## Directory Structure Analysis

This document explains the relationship between the `/out/` and `/public/` directories in the APTlantis project and provides recommendations for managing them.

### Findings

1. **Directory Overlap**: The `/out/` and `/public/` directories have nearly identical structures and content, including:
   - Logo files at the root level
   - `/assets/images/` directories
   - `/data/` directories with dashboard files
   - `/logos/` directories with distribution logos
   - `/shared/` directories with script.js and styles.css

2. **File Comparison**: Files with the same name in both directories are identical (confirmed by comparing file hashes).

3. **Build Configuration**: The project uses Vite as its build tool, as seen in `package.json`:
   ```
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "vite",
     "build": "vite build",
     "start": "vite preview"
   }
   ```

### Directory Roles

- **`/public/`**: This is the source directory for static assets in a Vite project. Files in this directory are copied as-is to the build output directory during the build process.

- **`/out/`**: This is the build output directory where the compiled application and copied static assets are placed. This directory is generated during the build process and should not be manually edited.

## Recommendations

1. **Source of Truth**: Use the `/public/` directory as the primary location for all static assets. Any changes to static assets should be made in this directory.

2. **Version Control**: The `/out/` directory has been added to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being version controlled. This is a best practice for build output directories.

3. **Build Process**: Continue using the current build process, which correctly copies files from `/public/` to `/out/`.

4. **Asset References**: When referencing assets in the code, use paths relative to the `/public/` directory (e.g., `/logos/aptlantis-logo.jpeg`), as these will correctly resolve to the corresponding files in the build output.

## Implementation Notes

- A `.gitignore` file has been created to exclude the `/out/` directory from version control.
- No changes to asset references in the code are needed, as they already use the correct paths.
- The `/out/` directory should be regenerated by running the build process (`npm run build` or `pnpm build`) rather than being manually edited.
